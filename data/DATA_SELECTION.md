# Data Selection Description

This document describes the rationale and criteria for selecting data for this MLP data handling project.

## Data Source

**Algoseek Free Sample**

The data source chosen for this project is a free sample from Algoseek. This provides access to options market data for demonstration and analysis purposes.

## Option Type Selection

**Equity Options (Not Futures Options)**

Futures options are not available in the free sample dataset. Therefore, equity options are used as a demonstration alternative. Equity options provide similar analytical value for understanding options market dynamics and can serve as a suitable proxy for the intended analysis.

## Stock Selection Criteria

**Heavy Volume and Most Volatile Stocks**

The selection focuses on stocks that meet two key criteria:

1. **Heavy Volume**: Stocks with high trading volume ensure sufficient data points and liquidity, making the data more representative and reliable for analysis.

2. **Most Volatile Stocks**: Highly volatile stocks provide more interesting option pricing dynamics and better demonstrate the behavior of options markets under varying market conditions.

**Note**: Further research is needed to determine the specific underliers (stocks) that best meet these criteria. This will involve analyzing historical volume and volatility metrics to identify the most suitable candidates.

## Sample Specification

**Date: January 29, 2020 (20200129)**

The sample data includes:
- Multiple stocks meeting the selection criteria
- Different expiry dates for each stock to capture various option contract maturities
- This allows for analysis across different time horizons and option characteristics
